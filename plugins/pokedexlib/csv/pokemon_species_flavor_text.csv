1,26,9,"Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight.
There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun’s rays,
the seed grows progressively larger."
2,26,9,"There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight,
Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong.
If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight,
it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon."
3,26,9,"There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said
to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.
The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people."
4,26,9,"The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication
of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander
is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged,
the flame burns fiercely."
5,26,9,"Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp
claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive.
In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with
a bluish white color."
6,26,9,"Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents.
It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.
However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent
weaker than itself."
7,26,9,"Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.
The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its
surface help minimize resistance in water,
enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds."
8,26,9,"Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail
becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.
The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s
toughness as a battler."
9,26,9,"Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell.
The water spouts are very accurate.
They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy
to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet."
10,26,9,"Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves
bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna,
this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor."
11,26,9,"The shell covering this Pokémon’s body is as hard as an
iron slab. Metapod does not move very much.
It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for
evolution inside the hard shell."
12,26,9,"Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey
from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey
from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest."
13,26,9,"Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable
of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."
14,26,9,"Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree.
However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares
for its coming evolution.
This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch."
15,26,9,"Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach
its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack
in a furious swarm."
16,26,9,"Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction.
It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest,
however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."
17,26,9,"Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This
Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory
is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe
with its sharp claws."
18,26,9,"This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully
glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the
striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling
them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon."
19,26,9,"Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep,
it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not
picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere."
20,26,9,"Raticate’s sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them
ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may
even chew on the walls of houses."
21,26,9,"Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over
half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all
around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."
22,26,9,"Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak.
They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or
water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey."
23,26,9,"Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this
position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any
direction with a glare from its upraised head."
24,26,9,"This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things
with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok
wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace
is impossible."
25,26,9,"This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks.
These appear to become electrically charged during the night
while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity
when it is dozy after waking up."
26,26,9,"This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over
its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness.
Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity."
27,26,9,"Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough.
The Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack.
At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep."
28,26,9,"Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered
with large spikes. In battle, this Pokémon will try to make
the foe flinch by jabbing it with its spines. It then leaps at
the stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws."
29,26,9,"Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison.
They are thought to have developed as protection for
this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases
a horrible toxin from its horn."
30,26,9,"When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep
their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other.
This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated
from the others."
31,26,9,"Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales.
It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This
Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."
32,26,9,"Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks
to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even
the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice."
33,26,9,"Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses
a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once,
and it challenges the foe with all its might."
34,26,9,"Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power.
With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once
this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it."
35,26,9,"On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon
come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy
return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep
nestled up against each other."
36,26,9,"Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using
its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water.
It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights."
37,26,9,"Inside Vulpix’s body burns a flame that never goes out.
During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this
Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its
body from growing too hot."
38,26,9,"Legend has it that Ninetales came into being when
nine wizards possessing sacred powers merged into one.
This Pokémon is highly intelligent—it can understand
human speech."
39,26,9,"When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe.
If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily
fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life."
40,26,9,"Wigglytuff’s body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply,
this Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end.
Once inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon."
41,26,9,"Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become
unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under
the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down."
42,26,9,"Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks
the victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark
moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon."
43,26,9,"Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself.
During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet
are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots
of trees."
44,26,9,"From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely
horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the
noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey."
45,26,9,"Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to
attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the
prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them."
46,26,9,"Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called
tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this
Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine
for extending life."
47,26,9,"Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain
nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested
tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once."
48,26,9,"Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair
that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large
eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey."
49,26,9,"Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes
active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather
around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."
50,26,9,"Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—
wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled
for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing
delicious vegetables."
51,26,9,"Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body.
As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two
triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly."
52,26,9,"Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak
about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some
reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light."
53,26,9,"Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness.
The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the
Pokémon’s surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed
by the whiskers."
54,26,9,"If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember
having done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such
an event because it goes into an altered state that is much
like deep sleep."
55,26,9,"Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims
effortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues
people from wrecked ships floundering in high seas."
56,26,9,"When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns
rough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However,
because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly,
it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath."
57,26,9,"When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation
is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger.
However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the
same time."
58,26,9,"Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything,
this Pokémon won’t forget the scent, no matter what. It uses
its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of
other living things."
59,26,9,"Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable
of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The
fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon’s body is its source
of power."
60,26,9,"Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the
Pokémon’s spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its
thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp
fangs bounce right off it."
61,26,9,"The surface of Poliwhirl’s body is always wet and slick with
a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily
slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle."
62,26,9,"Poliwrath’s highly developed, brawny muscles never grow
fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong,
this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean
without effort."
63,26,9,"Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn’t,
this Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is
attacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping."
64,26,9,"Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used
to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the
Pokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its
telekinetic powers."
65,26,9,"Alakazam’s brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying
brain cells. This amazing brain gives this Pokémon an
astoundingly high IQ of 5,000. It has a thorough memory
of everything that has occurred in the world."
66,26,9,"Machop exercises by hefting around a Graveler as if it were
a barbell. There are some Machop that travel the world in a
quest to master all kinds of martial arts."
67,26,9,"Machoke undertakes bodybuilding every day even as
it helps people with tough, physically demanding labor.
On its days off, this Pokémon heads to the fields and
mountains to exercise and train."
68,26,9,"Machamp is known as the Pokémon that has mastered
every kind of martial arts. If it grabs hold of the foe with its
four arms, the battle is all but over. The hapless foe is thrown
far over the horizon."
69,26,9,"Bellsprout’s thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway
to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth,
this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron."
70,26,9,"Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the
Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep.
If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself
on the ground."
71,26,9,"Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head.
This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal
to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near,
this Pokémon swallows it whole."
72,26,9,"Tentacool absorbs sunlight and refracts it using water inside
its body to convert it into beam energy. This Pokémon shoots
beams from the small round organ above its eyes."
73,26,9,"Tentacruel has tentacles that can be freely elongated
and shortened at will. It ensnares prey with its tentacles
and weakens the prey by dosing it with a harsh toxin.
It can catch up to 80 prey at the same time."
74,26,9,"When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the
ground. It will not awaken even if hikers step on it unwittingly.
In the morning, this Pokémon rolls downhill in search of food."
75,26,9,"Rocks are Graveler’s favorite food. This Pokémon will climb a
mountain from the base to the summit, crunchingly feasting on
rocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back down
to the bottom."
76,26,9,"Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent
them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves
have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as
guideways for diverting this Pokémon’s course."
77,26,9,"Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up.
This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and
falling to keep up with its parent."
78,26,9,"Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields
and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its
fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph."
79,26,9,"Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water
at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets
what it’s doing and often spends entire days just loafing
at water’s edge."
80,26,9,"Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite.
As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This
causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead."
81,26,9,"Magnemite floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves
from the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This
Pokémon becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical
supply is depleted."
82,26,9,"Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to
electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is
said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokémon
inside a Poké Ball."
83,26,9,"Farfetch’d is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some
sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This
Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks."
84,26,9,"Doduo’s two heads contain completely identical brains. A
scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be
examples of this Pokémon possessing different sets of brains."
85,26,9,"Apparently, the heads aren’t the only parts of the body that
Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as
well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest."
86,26,9,"Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice.
When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice
with the sharply protruding section of its head."
87,26,9,"Dewgong loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of
this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought
to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago."
88,26,9,"Grimer emerged from the sludge that settled on a polluted
seabed. This Pokémon loves anything filthy. It constantly
leaks a horribly germ-infested fluid from all over its body."
89,26,9,"This Pokémon’s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly
filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing
away litter on the streets, Muk are certain to gather."
90,26,9,"At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole
in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping,
Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out."
91,26,9,"Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by
swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This
Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system."
92,26,9,"Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed
to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away.
Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to
escape the ravages of wind."
93,26,9,"Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while
floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon
will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away."
94,26,9,"Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a
streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you.
It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be
your shadow."
95,26,9,"Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that
this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling.
As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder
and smoother."
96,26,9,"If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it’s a sure
sign that one of these Pokémon is standing above your pillow
and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils."
97,26,9,"Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and
glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of
hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes
the pendulum."
98,26,9,"Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into
the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food,
these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other
over territory."
99,26,9,"Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge
claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because
the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires."
100,26,9,"Voltorb is extremely sensitive—it explodes at the slightest
of shocks. It is rumored that it was first created when a
Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy."
101,26,9,"One of Electrode’s characteristics is its attraction to electricity.
It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at
electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just
been generated."
102,26,9,"This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit
cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around.
When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is
close to evolution."
103,26,9,"Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads
steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is
said that when the heads fall off, they group together to
form Exeggcute."
104,26,9,"Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a
likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on
the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds."
105,26,9,"Marowak is the evolved form of a Cubone that has overcome
its sadness at the loss of its mother and grown tough. This
Pokémon’s tempered and hardened spirit is not easily broken."
106,26,9,"Hitmonlee’s legs freely contract and stretch. Using these
springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks.
After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles
to overcome fatigue."
107,26,9,"Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had
been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon
has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face
of adversity."
108,26,9,"Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will
unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things
by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things."
109,26,9,"Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw
garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas
is concocted by this Pokémon."
110,26,9,"Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed,
the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also
becomes more putrid."
111,26,9,"Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run
it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently
remembers sometimes if it demolishes something."
112,26,9,"Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for
destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally
rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents
it from feeling the heat."
113,26,9,"Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis.
The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly
devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite."
114,26,9,"Tangela’s vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This
happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway.
The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very
next day."
115,26,9,"If you come across a young Kangaskhan playing by itself,
you must never disturb it or attempt to catch it. The baby
Pokémon’s parent is sure to be in the area, and it will
become violently enraged at you."
116,26,9,"If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense
black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon
swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back."
117,26,9,"Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body.
The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even
fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with
these currents, then swallows it whole."
118,26,9,"Goldeen loves swimming wild and free in rivers and ponds.
If one of these Pokémon is placed in an aquarium, it will
shatter even the thickest glass with one ram of its horn
and make its escape."
119,26,9,"Seaking is very protective of its eggs. The male and female
will take turns patrolling around their nest and eggs. The
guarding of eggs by these Pokémon goes on for over a month."
120,26,9,"Staryu apparently communicates with the stars in the night sky
by flashing the red core at the center of its body. If parts of its
body are torn, this Pokémon simply regenerates the missing
pieces and limbs."
121,26,9,"Starmie swims through water by spinning its star-shaped
body as if it were a propeller on a ship. The core at the
center of this Pokémon’s body glows in seven colors."
122,26,9,"Mr. Mime is a master of pantomime. Its gestures and motions
convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists.
Once the watchers are convinced, the unseeable thing exists
as if it were real."
123,26,9,"Scyther is blindingly fast. Its blazing speed enhances the
effectiveness of the twin scythes on its forearms. This
Pokémon’s scythes are so effective, they can slice through
thick logs in one wicked stroke."
124,26,9,"Jynx walks rhythmically, swaying and shaking its hips
as if it were dancing. Its motions are so bouncingly alluring,
people seeing it are compelled to shake their hips without
giving any thought to what they are doing."
125,26,9,"When a storm arrives, gangs of this Pokémon compete with
each other to scale heights that are likely to be stricken by
lightning bolts. Some towns use Electabuzz in place of
lightning rods."
126,26,9,"In battle, Magmar blows out intensely hot flames from
all over its body to intimidate its opponent. This Pokémon’s
fiery bursts create heat waves that ignite grass and trees in
its surroundings."
127,26,9,"Pinsir has a pair of massive horns. Protruding from the surface
of these horns are thorns. These thorns are driven deeply into
the foe’s body when the pincer closes, making it tough for the
foe to escape."
128,26,9,"This Pokémon is not satisfied unless it is rampaging at all
times. If there is no opponent for Tauros to battle, it will
charge at thick trees and knock them down to calm itself."
129,26,9,"Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash
around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However,
it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any
body of water no matter how polluted it is."
130,26,9,"Once Gyarados goes on a rampage, its ferociously violent
blood doesn’t calm until it has burned everything down.
There are records of this Pokémon’s rampages lasting a
whole month."
131,26,9,"People have driven Lapras almost to the point of extinction.
In the evenings, this Pokémon is said to sing plaintively as
it seeks what few others of its kind still remain."
132,26,9,"Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other
shapes. However, if it tries to transform itself into something
by relying on its memory, this Pokémon manages to get
details wrong."
133,26,9,"Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates
due to the environment in which it lives. Radiation from various
stones causes this Pokémon to evolve."
134,26,9,"Vaporeon underwent a spontaneous mutation and grew fins
and gills that allow it to live underwater. This Pokémon has
the ability to freely control water."
135,26,9,"Jolteon’s cells generate a low level of electricity. This power
is amplified by the static electricity of its fur, enabling the
Pokémon to drop thunderbolts. The bristling fur is made of
electrically charged needles."
136,26,9,"Flareon’s fluffy fur has a functional purpose—it releases heat
into the air so that its body does not get excessively hot.
This Pokémon’s body temperature can rise to a maximum of
1,650 degrees Fahrenheit."
137,26,9,"Porygon is capable of reverting itself entirely back to program
data and entering cyberspace. This Pokémon is copy protected
so it cannot be duplicated by copying."
138,26,9,"Omanyte is one of the ancient and long-since-extinct Pokémon
that have been regenerated from fossils by people. If attacked
by an enemy, it withdraws itself inside its hard shell."
139,26,9,"Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is
believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too
large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow
and ponderous."
140,26,9,"Kabuto is a Pokémon that has been regenerated from a fossil.
However, in extremely rare cases, living examples have
been discovered. The Pokémon has not changed at all for
300 million years."
141,26,9,"Kabutops swam underwater to hunt for its prey in ancient
times. The Pokémon was apparently evolving from being a
water dweller to living on land as evident from the beginnings
of change in its gills and legs."
142,26,9,"Aerodactyl is a Pokémon from the age of dinosaurs. It was
regenerated from genetic material extracted from amber. It is
imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times."

sleeping. It is such a docile Pokémon that there are children
who use its expansive belly as a place to play."

The flapping of its wings chills the air. As a result, it is said
that when this Pokémon flies, snow will fall."

to control electricity. It usually lives in thunderclouds.
The Pokémon gains power if it is stricken by lightning bolts."

manipulation. However, even though the scientific power
of humans created this Pokémon’s body, they failed to
endow Mewtwo with a compassionate heart."

Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will,
so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people."

bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf,
becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy,
friendly atmosphere all around."

tubular leaf is a small shoot of a tree. The fragrance of this

emotions. In battle, this Pokémon gives off more of its
becalming scent to blunt the foe’s fighting spirit."

The flames are vigorous if the Pokémon is angry. However, if it

it creates using its intensely hot flames. This Pokémon creates
blazing explosive blasts that burn everything to cinders."

powerful. While the Pokémon may think it is just playfully
nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury."
159,26,9,"Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will
absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are
forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible
to remove when they have sunk in."
160,26,9,"Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth.
In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful
hind legs to charge at the foe at an incredible speed."

squirm through narrow spaces and get away. In spite of its

earth’s rotation. Using this special organ, this Pokémon
begins hooting at precisely the same time every day."

minimal light, and to its soft, supple wings that make no sound
in flight."

body. This fluid is used for communicating with others.
This Pokémon conveys its feelings to others by altering the
fluid’s scent."

sky, there live Ledian in countless numbers. There is a good
reason for this—the Pokémon uses the light of the stars as
its energy."

nervous system. It is said that this Pokémon can determine
what kind of prey is touching its web just by the tiny vibrations

a marshmallow. From this body wafts a gently sweet fragrance
that soothes and calms the emotions of its foes."

compassion and pleasure exuded by people and Pokémon.

it is said to appear and share its happiness with that person."

flaps and leaps onto tree branches that are taller than
grown-up people to pick at the tree’s new shoots."

day long. Some people revere it as a mystical Pokémon out of
their belief that Xatu is in possession of the power to see into
the future."

charge. The more static electricity is charged, the more brightly
the lightbulb at the tip of its tail glows."

a high amount of static electricity with a small amount of
wool. The bare and slick parts of its hide are shielded
against electricity."

space. People in the old days used the light of this Pokémon
to send signals back and forth with others far away."
182,26,9,"A Bellossom grows flowers more beautifully if it has evolved
from a smelly Gloom—the more stinky the better. At night, this
Pokémon closes its petals and goes to sleep."
183,26,9,"When fishing for food at the edge of a fast-running stream,
Marill wraps its tail around the trunk of a tree. This Pokémon’s
tail is flexible and configured to stretch."

balloons if it spots a drowning Pokémon. The air balloons
enable the Pokémon in trouble to breathe."

attacked by enemies. However, because its hands remain
green throughout the year, the Pokémon is easily identified
as a fake during the winter."

king. It is said that the longer and more curled the hair, the

approach of strong winds, Hoppip links its leaves with other
Hoppip to prepare against being blown away."

depends on the temperature. For that reason, this Pokémon
is sometimes used as a thermometer."

foreign lands. The Pokémon descends to the ground when it
encounters cold air while it is floating."

manipulated. However, because the Pokémon uses its tail so
much, its real hands have become rather clumsy."
191,26,9,"Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can. It does so
because it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its
body for its evolution. It will not eat a thing, subsisting only on

out onto land in search of food. On land, it coats its body with
a gooey, toxic film."

precognitive powers to protect its Trainer from harm."

its own. However, it won’t endure an attack on its tail. When
that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using
Destiny Bond."

thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to sleep, so it
can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours a day."

fazed by ordinary sorts of attacks. This Pokémon flaps its

convenient for collecting pollen from flowers. This Pokémon

would be weak upon evolution. This Pokémon will also not
forget the pain it endured."

spores from the top of its head. This Pokémon’s spores are

in a Poké Ball after a Nincada evolves. This bizarre Pokémon
is entirely immobile—it doesn’t even breathe."

the world of spirits that command it to take
people there."

infiltrate electronic devices and wreak havoc."

intelligence to improve their quality of life."

leave its body to fly on the lake’s surface."

from the same egg."

Sinnoh-region myths as an ancient deity."
484,26,9,"It has the ability to distort space. It is described as
a deity in Sinnoh-region mythology."

body. It makes its dwelling place in volcanic caves."
486,26,9,"There is an enduring legend that states this
Pokémon towed continents with ropes."
487,26,9,"It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed
upon the old world from the Distortion World."
488,26,9,"Those who sleep holding Cresselia’s feather are
assured of joyful dreams. It is said to represent
the crescent moon."

was born, no matter how far it may have drifted."

it to bond with any kind of Pokémon."
491,26,9,"It can lull people to sleep and make them dream.
It is active during nights of the new moon."

power of flight upon it. Feelings of gratitude are
the message it delivers."
493,26,9,"It is told in mythology that this Pokémon was born
before the universe even existed."
494,26,9,"When it shares the infinite energy it creates,
that being’s entire body will be overflowing
with power."
495,26,9,"They photosynthesize by bathing their tails in
sunlight. When they are not feeling well, their
tails droop."
496,26,9,"When it gets dirty, its leaves can’t be used in
photosynthesis, so it always keeps itself clean."
497,26,9,"It can stop its opponents’ movements with just a
glare. It takes in solar energy and boosts
it internally."
498,26,9,"It loves to eat roasted berries, but sometimes it
gets too excited and burns them to a crisp."
499,26,9,"When its internal fire flares up, its movements grow
sharper and faster. When in trouble, it emits smoke."
500,26,9,"It has mastered fast and powerful fighting moves.
It grows a beard of fire."
501,26,9,"It fights using the scalchop on its stomach.
In response to an attack, it retaliates immediately
by slashing."
502,26,9,"As a result of strict training, each Dewott learns
different forms for using the scalchops."
503,26,9,"One swing of the sword incorporated in its armor
can fell an opponent. A simple glare from one of
them quiets everybody."
504,26,9,"Extremely cautious, one of them will always be on
the lookout, but it won’t notice a foe coming
from behind."
505,26,9,"When they see an enemy, their tails stand high,
and they spit the seeds of berries stored in their
cheek pouches."
506,26,9,"Though it is a very brave Pokémon, it’s also smart
enough to check its foe’s strength and avoid battle."
507,26,9,"It has black, cape-like fur that is very hard and
decreases the amount of damage it receives."
508,26,9,"Being wrapped in its long fur is so comfortable
that a person would be fine even overnight on a
wintry mountain."
509,26,9,"They steal from people for fun, but their victims
can’t help but forgive them. Their deceptively cute
act is perfect."
510,26,9,"Stealthily, it sneaks up on its target, striking from
behind before its victim has a chance to react."
511,26,9,"It’s good at finding berries and gathers them from
all over. It’s kind enough to share them
with friends."
512,26,9,"Ill tempered, it fights by swinging its barbed tail
around wildly. The leaf growing on its head is
very bitter."
513,26,9,"This Pokémon lives in caves in volcanoes.
The fire within the tuft on its head can reach
600 degrees Fahrenheit."
514,26,9,"When it gets excited, embers rise from its head
and tail and it gets hot. For some reason, it
loves sweets."
515,26,9,"The water stored inside the tuft on its head is full of
nutrients. Plants that receive its water grow large."
516,26,9,"It prefers places with clean water. When its tuft runs
low, it replenishes it by siphoning up water with
its tail."
517,26,9,"It eats the dreams of people and Pokémon. When it
eats a pleasant dream, it expels pink-colored mist."
518,26,9,"The dream mist coming from its forehead changes
into many different colors depending on the dream
that was eaten."
519,26,9,"These Pokémon live in cities. They are accustomed
to people. Flocks often gather in parks and plazas."
520,26,9,"No matter where in the world it goes, it knows
where its nest is, so it never gets separated from
its Trainer."
521,26,9,"Males have plumage on their heads. They will never
let themselves feel close to anyone other than
their Trainers."
522,26,9,"Its mane shines when it discharges electricity.
They use the frequency and rhythm of these flashes
to communicate."
523,26,9,"They have lightning-like movements.
When Zebstrika run at full speed, the sound of
thunder reverberates."
524,26,9,"They were discovered a hundred years ago in an
earthquake fissure. Inside each one is an
energy core."
525,26,9,"When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing
the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left
to right."
526,26,9,"Compressing the energy from its internal core
lets it fire off an attack capable of blowing away
a mountain."
527,26,9,"The heart-shaped mark left on a body after a
Woobat has been attached to it is said to bring
good fortune."
528,26,9,"Anyone who comes into contact with the ultrasonic
waves emitted by a courting male experiences a
positive mood shift."
529,26,9,"By spinning its body, it can dig straight through the
ground at a speed of 30 mph."
530,26,9,"More than 300 feet below the surface, they build
mazelike nests. Their activity can be destructive to
subway tunnels."
531,26,9,"It touches others with the feelers on its ears, using
the sound of their heartbeats to tell how they
are feeling."
532,26,9,"Always carrying squared logs, they help out with
construction. As they grow, they carry bigger logs."
533,26,9,"This Pokémon is so muscular and strongly built that
even a group of wrestlers could not make it budge
an inch."
534,26,9,"Rather than rely on force, they master moves that
utilize the centrifugal force of spinning concrete."
535,26,9,"By vibrating its cheeks, it emits sound waves
imperceptible to humans. It uses the rhythm of
these sounds to talk."
536,26,9,"It lives in the water and on land. It uses its long,
sticky tongue to immobilize its opponents."
537,26,9,"They shoot paralyzing liquid from their head bumps.
They use vibration to hurt their opponents."
538,26,9,"When it encounters a foe bigger than itself, it wants
to throw it. It changes belts as it gets stronger."
539,26,9,"Tying their belts gets them pumped and makes their
punches more destructive. Disturbing their training
angers them."
540,26,9,"Since this Pokémon makes its own clothes out of
leaves, it is a popular mascot for fashion designers."
541,26,9,"It protects itself from the cold by wrapping up in
leaves. It stays on the move, eating leaves
in forests."
542,26,9,"It keeps its eggs warm with heat from fermenting
leaves. It also uses leaves to make warm wrappings
for Sewaddle."
543,26,9,"Its bite injects a potent poison, enough to paralyze
large bird Pokémon that try to prey on it."
544,26,9,"It is usually motionless, but when attacked,
it rotates at high speed and then crashes into
its opponent."
545,26,9,"With quick movements, it chases down its foes,
attacking relentlessly with its horns until it prevails."
546,26,9,"Perhaps because they feel more at ease in a group,
they stick to others they find. They end up looking
like a cloud."
547,26,9,"Like the wind, it can slip through any gap,
no matter how small. It leaves balls of white
fluff behind."
548,26,9,"Since they prefer moist, nutrient-rich soil, the areas
where Petilil live are known to be good for
growing plants."
549,26,9,"Even veteran Trainers face a challenge in getting its
beautiful flower to bloom. This Pokémon is popular
with celebrities."
550,26,9,"Red and blue Basculin usually do not get along,
but sometimes members of one school mingle with
the other’s school."
551,26,9,"They live buried in the sands of the desert.
The sun-warmed sands prevent their body
temperature from dropping."
552,26,9,"The special membrane covering its eyes can sense
the heat of objects, so it can see its surroundings
even in darkness."
553,26,9,"They never allow prey to escape. Their jaws
are so powerful, they can crush the body of
an automobile."
554,26,9,"When it sleeps, it pulls its limbs into its
body and its internal fire goes down to
1,100 degrees Fahrenheit."
555,26,9,"Its internal fire burns at 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit,
making enough power that it can destroy a dump
truck with one punch."
556,26,9,"Arid regions are their habitat. They move
rhythmically, making a sound similar to maracas."
557,26,9,"When it finds a stone of a suitable size, it secretes
a liquid from its mouth to open up a hole to
crawl into."
558,26,9,"Competing for territory, Crustle fight viciously.
The one whose boulder is broken is the loser of
the battle."
559,26,9,"Proud of its sturdy skull, it suddenly headbutts
everything, but its weight makes it unstable, too."
560,26,9,"It can smash concrete blocks with its kicking
attacks. The one with the biggest crest is the
group leader."
561,26,9,"The guardians of an ancient city, they always fly
the same route while keeping watch for invaders."
562,26,9,"Each of them carries a mask that used to be its face
when it was human. Sometimes they look at it
and cry."
563,26,9,"Grave robbers who mistake them for real coffins and
get too close end up trapped inside their bodies."
564,26,9,"Restored from a fossil, this Pokémon can dive to
depths beyond half a mile."
565,26,9,"It could knock out a foe with a slap from one of its
developed front appendages and chew it up, shell
or bones and all."
566,26,9,"Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, they were
unable to fly and moved about by hopping from one
branch to another."
567,26,9,"It runs better than it flies. It takes off into the sky
by running at a speed of 25 mph."
568,26,9,"Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for
a week. They prefer unsanitary places."
569,26,9,"Consuming garbage makes new kinds of poison
gases and liquids inside their bodies."
570,26,9,"To protect themselves from danger, they hide their
true identities by transforming into people
and Pokémon."
571,26,9,"Bonds between these Pokémon are very strong.
It protects the safety of its pack by tricking
its opponents."
572,26,9,"These Pokémon prefer a tidy habitat. They are
always sweeping and dusting, using their tails
as brooms."
573,26,9,"Cinccino’s body is coated in a special oil that helps
it deflect attacks, such as punches."
574,26,9,"They intently observe both Trainers and Pokémon.
Apparently, they are looking at something that only
Gothita can see."
575,26,9,"According to many old tales, it creates friends for
itself by controlling sleeping children on
starry nights."
576,26,9,"They can predict the future from the placement and
movement of the stars. They can see Trainers’
life spans."
577,26,9,"They drive away attackers by unleashing psychic
power. They can use telepathy to talk with others."
578,26,9,"When their two divided brains think the same
thoughts, their psychic power is maximized."
579,26,9,"When Reuniclus shake hands, a network forms
between their brains, increasing their
psychic power."
580,26,9,"They are better at swimming than flying, and they
happily eat their favorite food, peat moss, as they
dive underwater."
581,26,9,"Swanna start to dance at dusk. The one dancing in
the middle is the leader of the flock."
582,26,9,"This Pokémon formed from icicles bathed in energy
from the morning sun. It sleeps buried in snow."
583,26,9,"Snowy mountains are this Pokémon’s habitat.
During an ancient ice age, they moved to
southern areas."
584,26,9,"Swallowing large amounts of water, they make
snow clouds inside their bodies and, when angry,
cause violent blizzards."
585,26,9,"The turning of the seasons changes the color and
scent of this Pokémon’s fur. People use it to mark
the seasons."
586,26,9,"They migrate according to the seasons, so some
people call Sawsbuck the harbingers of spring."
587,26,9,"The energy made in its cheeks’ electric pouches is
stored inside its membrane and released while it
is gliding."
588,26,9,"For some reason they evolve when they receive
electrical energy while they are attacking Shelmet."
589,26,9,"These Pokémon evolve by wearing the shell
covering of a Shelmet. The steel armor protects
their whole body."
590,26,9,"It lures Pokémon with its pattern that looks just like
a Poké Ball, then releases poison spores."
591,26,9,"It lures prey close by dancing and waving its
arm caps, which resemble Poké Balls, in a
swaying motion."
592,26,9,"If its veil-like arms stun and wrap a foe, that foe will
be dragged miles below the surface, never
to return."
593,26,9,"The fate of the ships and crew that wander into
Jellicent’s habitat: all sunken, all lost, all vanished."
594,26,9,"It gently holds injured and weak Pokémon in its
fins. Its special membrane heals their wounds."
595,26,9,"They attach themselves to large-bodied Pokémon
and absorb static electricity, which they store in an
electric pouch."
596,26,9,"When attacked, they create an electric barrier by
spitting out many electrically charged threads."
597,26,9,"It absorbs the iron it finds in the rock while clinging
to the ceiling. It shoots spikes when in danger."
598,26,9,"They attach themselves to cave ceilings, firing steel
spikes at targets passing beneath them."
599,26,9,"The two minigears that mesh together are
predetermined. Each will rebound from other
minigears without meshing."
600,26,9,"A minigear and big gear comprise its body. If the
minigear it launches at a foe doesn’t return, it
will die."
601,26,9,"Its red core functions as an energy tank. It fires the
charged energy through its spikes into an area."
602,26,9,"One alone can emit only a trickle of electricity,
so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful
electric shock."
603,26,9,"These Pokémon have a big appetite. When they
spot their prey, they attack it and paralyze it
with electricity."
604,26,9,"They crawl out of the ocean using their arms.
They will attack prey on shore and immediately drag
it into the ocean."
605,26,9,"Rumors of its origin are linked to a UFO crash site
in the desert 50 years ago."
606,26,9,"It uses psychic power to control an opponent’s
brain and tamper with its memories."
607,26,9,"Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of
people and Pokémon, which becomes the fuel that
it burns."
608,26,9,"It arrives near the moment of death and steals spirit
from the body."
609,26,9,"The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their
way and wander this world forever."
610,26,9,"They mark their territory by leaving gashes in trees
with their tusks. If a tusk breaks, a new one grows
in quickly."
611,26,9,"A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently
sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of
a battle."
612,26,9,"Their sturdy tusks will stay sharp even if used to cut
steel beams. These Pokémon are covered in
hard armor."
613,26,9,"Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy,
their snot is sticky and the power of their ice
moves increases."
614,26,9,"It freezes its breath to create fangs and claws of ice
to fight with. Cold northern areas are its habitat."
615,26,9,"They are composed of ice crystals. They capture
prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at
-148 degrees Fahrenheit."
616,26,9,"It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy
along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown."
617,26,9,"When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent
dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of
thin membrane."
618,26,9,"It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore.
Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt
of electricity."
619,26,9,"In fights, they dominate with onslaughts of flowing,
continuous attacks. With their sharp claws, they
cut enemies."
620,26,9,"Using the long fur on its arms like whips, it
launches into combo attacks that, once started,
no one can stop."
621,26,9,"It warms its body by absorbing sunlight with its
wings. When its body temperature falls, it can no
longer move."
622,26,9,"Ancient science fashioned this Pokémon from clay.
It’s been active for thousands of years."
623,26,9,"It flies across the sky at Mach speeds. Removing
the seal on its chest makes its internal energy go
out of control."
624,26,9,"Ignoring their injuries, groups attack by sinking
the blades that cover their bodies into their prey."
625,26,9,"Bisharp pursues prey in the company of a large
group of Pawniard. Then Bisharp finishes off
the prey."
626,26,9,"Their fluffy fur absorbs damage, even if they strike
foes with a fierce headbutt."
627,26,9,"They will challenge anything, even strong
opponents, without fear. Their frequent fights help
them become stronger."
628,26,9,"They fight for their friends without any thought
about danger to themselves. One can carry a car
while flying."
629,26,9,"Their wings are too tiny to allow them to fly.
They guard their posteriors with bones that were
gathered by Mandibuzz."
630,26,9,"Watching from the sky, they swoop to strike
weakened Pokémon on the ground. They decorate
themselves with bones."
631,26,9,"It draws in air through its tail, transforms it into fire,
and uses it like a tongue. It melts Durant and
eats them."
632,26,9,"They attack in groups, covering themselves in steel
armor to protect themselves from Heatmor."
633,26,9,"Lacking sight, it’s unaware of its surroundings,
so it bumps into things and eats anything
that moves."
634,26,9,"After it has eaten up all the food in its territory,
it moves to another area. Its two heads do not
get along."
635,26,9,"It responds to movement by attacking. This scary,
three-headed Pokémon devours everything in
its path!"
636,26,9,"The base of volcanoes is where they make their
homes. They shoot fire from their five horns to repel
attacking enemies."
637,26,9,"When volcanic ash darkened the atmosphere, it is
said that Volcarona’s fire provided a replacement
for the sun."
638,26,9,"It has a body and heart of steel. It worked with its
allies to punish people when they hurt Pokémon."
639,26,9,"Spoken of in legend, this Pokémon used its
phenomenal power to destroy a castle in its effort
to protect Pokémon."
640,26,9,"Legends say this Pokémon confounded opponents
with its swift movements."
641,26,9,"Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail,
causing severe storms. Its power is great enough
to blow houses away."
642,26,9,"As it flies around, it shoots lightning all over
the place and causes forest fires. It is
therefore disliked."
643,26,9,"When Reshiram’s tail flares, the heat energy moves
the atmosphere and changes the world’s weather."
644,26,9,"Concealing itself in lightning clouds, it flies
throughout the Unova region. It creates electricity
in its tail."
645,26,9,"From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates
energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the
land abundant."
646,26,9,"It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside
itself, but its body became frozen when the energy
leaked out."
647,26,9,"When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it
becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast
to follow."
648,26,9,"Its melodies are sung with a special vocalization
method that can control the feelings of those who
hear it."
649,26,9,"This Pokémon existed 300 million years ago. Team
Plasma altered it and attached a cannon to its back."
650,26,9,"Such a thick shell of wood covers its head and back
that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn’t faze it."
651,26,9,"They strengthen their lower bodies by
running into one another. They are very
kind and won’t start fights."
652,26,9,"When it takes a defensive posture with its fists
guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast."
653,26,9,"As it walks, it munches on a twig in place
of a snack. It intimidates opponents
by puffing hot air out of its ears."
654,26,9,"When the twig is plucked from its tail,
friction sets the twig alight. The flame
is used to send signals to its allies."
655,26,9,"Using psychic power, it generates a
fiery vortex of 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit,
incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame."
656,26,9,"It protects its skin by covering its body in
delicate bubbles. Beneath its happy-go-lucky air,
it keeps a watchful eye on its surroundings."
657,26,9,"Its swiftness is unparalleled.
It can scale a tower of more
than 2,000 feet in a minute’s time."
658,26,9,"It appears and vanishes with a ninja’s grace.
It toys with its enemies using swift movements, while
slicing them with throwing stars of sharpest water."
659,26,9,"It has ears like shovels. Digging holes
strengthens its ears so much that they
can sever thick roots effortlessly."
660,26,9,"As powerful as an excavator, its ears
can reduce dense bedrock to rubble.
When it’s finished digging, it lounges lazily."
661,26,9,"Despite the beauty of its lilting voice, it’s
merciless to intruders that enter its territory."
662,26,9,"The hotter the flame sac on its belly,
the faster it can fly, but it takes some
time to get the fire going."
663,26,9,"When attacking prey, it can reach speeds
of up to 310 mph. It finishes its prey off
with a colossal kick."
664,26,9,"The powder that covers its body
regulates its temperature, so it
can live in any region or climate."
665,26,9,"The beaks of bird Pokémon can’t begin
to scratch its stalwart body.
To defend itself, it spews powder."
666,26,9,"The patterns on this Pokémon’s wings
depend on the climate and topography
of its habitat. It scatters colorful scales."
667,26,9,"They set off on their own from their pride
and live by themselves to become stronger.
These hot-blooded Pokémon are quick to fight."
668,26,9,"With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger.
The females protect the pride’s cubs."
669,26,9,"When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on
that flower its whole life long. It floats in the
wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart."
670,26,9,"When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom,
it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance."
671,26,9,"In times long past, governors of castles
would invite Florges to create flower gardens
to embellish the castle domains."
672,26,9,"If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t
need to eat, because it can generate
energy from the leaves on its back."
673,26,9,"They inhabit mountainous regions.
The leader of the herd is decided by
a battle of clashing horns."
674,26,9,"It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face,
but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
675,26,9,"It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like
a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take.
Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole."
676,26,9,"Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon
were the designated guardians of the king."
677,26,9,"It has enough psychic energy to blast
everything within 300 feet of itself,
but it has no control over its power."
678,26,9,"The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears
emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly
covered because that power is too immense."
679,26,9,"If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps
a blue cloth around that person’s arm and
drains that person’s life energy completely."
680,26,9,"The complex attack patterns of its two swords
are unstoppable, even for an opponent
greatly accomplished at swordplay."
681,26,9,"Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities
of leadership. According to legend, whoever it
recognizes is destined to become king."
682,26,9,"In the past, rather than using perfume,
royal ladies carried a Spritzee
that would waft a fragrance they liked."
683,26,9,"Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer
happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will
have a hard time walking alongside it."
684,26,9,"Because it eats nothing but sweets,
its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
685,26,9,"Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than
a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about
everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
686,26,9,"It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body,
which drains its opponent’s will to fight.
It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide."
687,26,9,"It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions,
then wraps its tentacles around it before
finishing it off with digestive fluids."
688,26,9,"They stretch and then contract, yanking their
rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat
seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
689,26,9,"Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds
of their own, and they will move independently.
But they usually follow the head’s orders."
690,26,9,"It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes
while storing up power for its evolution."
691,26,9,"Tales are told of ships that wander into
seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
692,26,9,"Through controlled explosions of internal gas,
it can expel water like a pistol shot.
At close distances, it can shatter rock."
693,26,9,"By expelling water from the nozzle in the back
of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
694,26,9,"The frills on either side of its head have cells
that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
695,26,9,"It stimulates its muscles with electricity,
boosting the strength in its legs and enabling
it to run 100 yards in five seconds."
696,26,9,"Its immense jaws have enough destructive
force that it can chew up an automobile.
It lived 100 million years ago."
697,26,9,"Nothing could stop this Pokémon
100 million years ago,
so it behaved like a king."
698,26,9,"This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where
there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum."
699,26,9,"Using its diamond-shaped crystals,
it can instantly create a wall of
ice to block an opponent’s attack."
700,26,9,"It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around
the arm of its beloved Trainer
and walks with him or her."
701,26,9,"With its wings, it controls its position in the air.
It likes to attack from above, a maneuver that
is difficult to defend against."
702,26,9,"It uses its tail to absorb electricity from
power plants or from outlets in houses,
and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers."
703,26,9,"It has slept underground for hundreds of millions
of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found
during the excavation of caves."
704,26,9,"It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes
any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly."
705,26,9,"Its four horns are a high-performance radar system.
It uses them to sense sounds and smells,
rather than using ears or a nose."
706,26,9,"It attacks with retractable horns.
It throws a punch that’s the equivalent
of the force of a hundred pro boxers."
707,26,9,"It never lets go of a key that it likes,
so people give it the keys to vaults and
safes as a way to prevent crime."
708,26,9,"According to old tales, these Pokémon are
stumps possessed by the spirits of
children who died while lost in the forest."
709,26,9,"Using its roots as a nervous system,
it controls the trees in the forest.
It’s kind to the Pokémon that reside in its body."
710,26,9,"It is said to carry wandering spirits
to the place where they belong
so they can move on."
711,26,9,"It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms.
It sings joyfully as it observes the
suffering of its prey."
712,26,9,"Using air of -150 degrees Fahrenheit, they
freeze opponents solid. They live in herds
above the snow line on mountains."
713,26,9,"The way several Bergmite huddle
on its back makes it look like
an aircraft carrier made of ice."
714,26,9,"Even a robust wrestler will become
dizzy and unable to stand when exposed
to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves."
715,26,9,"The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears
can reduce a large boulder to pebbles.
It swoops out of the dark to attack."
716,26,9,"When the horns on its head shine
in seven colors, it is said to be
sharing everlasting life."
717,26,9,"When its life comes to an end, it absorbs
the life energy of every living thing
and turns into a cocoon once more."
718,26,9,"It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring
those who destroy the ecosystem
from deep in the cave where it lives."
719,26,9,"It can instantly create many diamonds
by compressing the carbon in the air
between its hands."
720,26,9,"It is said to be able to seize anything it desires
with its six rings and six huge arms. With its power
sealed, it is transformed into a much smaller form."
721,26,9,"It expels its internal steam from the
arms on its back. It has enough
power to blow away a mountain."
722,30,9,"It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has
been known to use its Trainer’s pocket or bag
as a nest."
723,30,9,"Supremely sensitive to the presence of others,
it can detect opponents standing behind it,
flinging its sharp feathers to take them out."
724,30,9,"Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an
enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are
decided in the blink of an eye."
725,30,9,"Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time
comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and
burns away the old fur."
726,30,9,"When its mane is standing on end, you can tell
it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur
will lie down flat."
727,30,9,"When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames
around its waist become especially intense."
728,30,9,"Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons
to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!"
729,30,9,"It attacks by smacking its enemies with the
exploding water balloons that it creates."
730,30,9,"Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical
look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony
in song."
731,30,9,"It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are
heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times
per second!"
732,30,9,"From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries
it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise
to new plants."
733,30,9,"Known for forming harmonious couples, this
Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a
good luck charm."
734,30,9,"Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh
living things, so it marches down streets
in search of prey."
735,30,9,"Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of
itself and pounces when it spots its favorite
meal—Rattata!"
736,30,9,"It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in
their tracks, and then it grabs them in its
sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
737,30,9,"Its stout shell provides excellent defense from
attacks. It uses electricity on
persistent opponents."
738,30,9,"Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic
flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for
it to deliver an electric beam attack."
739,30,9,"Crabrawler has been known to mistake
Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The
enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it."
740,30,9,"Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling.
There are records of its turning back
avalanches with a flurry of punches."
741,30,9,"This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer
gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon
becomes fiercely angry."
742,30,9,"Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It
skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’
movements and make fools of them."
743,30,9,"It can predict the weather from moisture levels
and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself
when there are a few clear days in a row."
744,30,9,"When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you,
that’s proof of its love for you. However, the
rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!"
745,30,9,"The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife.
Fragments that break off are treasured as
good luck charms."
746,30,9,"When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract
others of its kind. The light from its eyes is
visible almost 25 miles away."
747,30,9,"Aside from its head, its body parts
regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a
good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
748,30,9,"With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter
within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect
Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
749,30,9,"Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be
loaded with 50 times its own body weight
and will be totally fine."
750,30,9,"It can trudge mountain roads without rest
for three days and three nights, all the while
dragging a 10-ton load."
751,30,9,"It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in
water, so it wears a water bubble on its head
when it walks around on land."
752,30,9,"It has a habit of storing things it values in its
water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out,
Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!"
753,30,9,"It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the
sunlight regularly, it grows up with
vivid coloration."
754,30,9,"As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s
dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some
to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon."
755,30,9,"It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the
spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow."
756,30,9,"When it starts fighting for territory with
Parasect, the entire area gets completely
coated in spores!"
757,30,9,"It weakens opponents and sends them
reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t
deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling."
758,30,9,"It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food
with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm."
759,30,9,"Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any
way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with
amazing power."
760,30,9,"It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many
people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in
the Alola region."
761,30,9,"It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird
Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head.
It’s usually a fruitless attempt."
762,30,9,"It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its
head with abandon. They’re quite painful when
they smack you!"
763,30,9,"A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and
a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it
kicks an opponent."
764,30,9,"It picks flowers and sticks them to its body
with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts
from its petals has a healing effect."
765,30,9,"Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so
they’re always engaging in battles of wits to
decide which one is superior."
766,30,9,"Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of
its diet. The one that can throw a berry the
farthest is the boss of the troop."
767,30,9,"An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod
will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if
anything comes near it."
768,30,9,"Its claws, which it can extend and retract at
will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is
sometimes accompanied by Wimpod."
769,30,9,"If you build sand mounds when you’re playing,
destroy them before you go home, or they
may get possessed and become Sandygast."
770,30,9,"Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt
its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying
Pokémon snatches away their vitality."
771,30,9,"Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will
get mad and smack you!"
772,30,9,"There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its
true power is sealed away beneath its
control mask."
773,30,9,"Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its
will was strengthened, and it was able to
destroy its control mask."
774,30,9,"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable,
the shock of falling to the ground smashes the
shell to smithereens."
775,30,9,"It remains asleep from birth to death as a result
of the sedative properties of the leaves that
form its diet."
776,30,9,"Its exploding shell poses a real danger but
is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days,
Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves."
777,30,9,"Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat
limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning
strike it!"
778,30,9,"A gust of wind revealed what hides under this
Pokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went
home and died painfully that very night."
779,30,9,"Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s
spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches
up the spikes and eats them."
780,30,9,"It appears in towns and plays with the children.
Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger,
so their moms don’t have to worry."
781,30,9,"Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch
outward for hundreds of yards. For some
reason, it gets along well with Skrelp."
782,30,9,"It will never show an enemy its back in battle.
Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant
disposition and made it one of their own."
783,30,9,"The scales it sheds can be molded and
processed to make pots and pans. They
conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item."
784,30,9,"It battles valiantly with its fists, which are
armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes
in uppercuts."
785,30,9,"The lightning-wielding guardian deity of
Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity
and appears before people from time to time."
786,30,9,"Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is
devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and
can be described as nature incarnate."
787,30,9,"It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others
know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts.
This guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants."
788,30,9,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible
calamities sometimes befall those who
recklessly approach Tapu Fini."
789,30,9,"Whether or not it’s a Pokémon from this world
is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away
to a safe place to hide."
790,30,9,"As it absorbs light, Cosmoem continues to grow.
Its golden shell is surprisingly solid."
791,30,9,"In writings from the distant past, it’s called by
the name “the beast that devours the sun.”"
792,30,9,"It sometimes summons unknown powers and
life-forms here to this world from holes that
lead to other worlds."
793,30,9,"It appeared in this world from an Ultra
Wormhole. Nihilego appears to be a parasite
that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon."
794,30,9,"Buzzwole goes around showing off its
abnormally swollen muscles. It is one kind
of Ultra Beast."
795,30,9,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
796,30,9,"They’ve been dubbed Ultra Beasts. Some of
them stand unmoving, like trees, with their
arms and legs stuck into the ground."
797,30,9,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
798,30,9,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
799,30,9,"An unknown life-form called a UB. It may be
constantly hungry—it is certainly always
devouring something."
800,30,9,"Light is the source of its energy. If it isn’t
devouring light, impurities build up in it and on it,
and Necrozma darkens and stops moving."
801,30,9,"Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist,
the part called the Soul-Heart is the
actual life-form."
802,30,9,"It sinks into the shadows of people and
Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings
and copy their capabilities."
803,30,9,"An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it
cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with
poison from the needles on its head."
804,30,9,"One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing,
venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid
is also immensely adhesive."
805,30,9,"When stone walls started moving and attacking,
the brute’s true identity was this mysterious
life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast."
806,30,9,"A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it
causes explosions, then takes advantage of
opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality."
807,30,9,"It approaches its enemies at the speed of
lightning, then tears them limb from limb with
its sharp claws."
808,34,9,"They live as a group, but when the time comes,
one strong Meltan will absorb all the others
and evolve."
809,34,9,"Centrifugal force is behind the punches of
Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said
to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon."
810,34,9,"It attacks with rapid beats of its stick.
As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets
more and more pumped."
811,34,9,"When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it
gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even
notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent."
812,34,9,"The one with the best drumming techniques
becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle
disposition and values harmony among its group."
813,34,9,"It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and
one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these
pads radiate tremendous heat."
814,34,9,"It kicks berries right off the branches of trees
and then juggles them with its feet, practicing
its footwork."
815,34,9,"It’s skilled at both offense and defense, and it
gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts
showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot."
816,34,9,"When it gets wet, its skin changes color,
and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if
it were camouflaged."
817,34,9,"Highly intelligent but also very lazy,
it keeps enemies out of its territory
by laying traps everywhere."
818,34,9,"Its nictitating membranes let it pick out foes’
weak points so it can precisely blast them with
water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3."
819,34,9,"It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made
it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on
farms, searching for yet more berries."
820,34,9,"Common throughout the Galar region, this
Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew
through the toughest of berry shells."
821,34,9,"Jumping nimbly about, this small-bodied
Pokémon takes advantage of even the slightest
opportunity to disorient larger opponents."
822,34,9,"The lessons of many harsh battles have taught it
how to accurately judge an opponent’s strength."
823,34,9,"With their great intellect and flying skills, these
Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar
region’s airborne taxi service."
824,34,9,"Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs
on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings."
825,34,9,"As it grows inside its shell, it uses its psychic
abilities to monitor the outside world and
prepare for evolution."
826,34,9,"It emits psychic energy to observe and study
what’s around it—and what’s around it can
include things over six miles away."
827,34,9,"Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by
stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with
swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder."
828,34,9,"With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes
around stealing food and eggs. Boltund
is its natural enemy."
829,34,9,"It whirls around in the wind while singing a joyous
song. This delightful display has charmed many
into raising this Pokémon."
830,34,9,"The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be
spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar
regional specialty."
831,34,9,"If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be
able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this
Pokémon is surprisingly strong."
832,34,9,"Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the
opposite gender. They never see use in battle."
833,34,9,"It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard
horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this
Pokémon bites down and never lets go."
834,34,9,"This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck
to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and
take them down."
835,34,9,"This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with
their work because it wants treats. As it runs,
it crackles with electricity."
836,34,9,"It sends electricity through its legs to boost their
strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks
50 mph."
837,34,9,"It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough,
rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it."
838,34,9,"By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over
18 mph. The temperature of the flames it
breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
839,34,9,"While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal
will burn bright red, sending off sparks that
scorch the surrounding area."
840,34,9,"As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not
only does the apple serve as its food source, but
the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution."
841,34,9,"It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a
powerful acid. It can also change its shape
into that of an apple."
842,34,9,"Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the
skin on its back is especially yummy. Children
used to have it as a snack."
843,34,9,"It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy
is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide."
844,34,9,"Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand
out of its sand sac more efficiently."
845,34,9,"This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole.
Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to
swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey."
846,34,9,"After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become
extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant
swallows it up."
847,34,9,"It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging
forward at speeds of over 100 knots before
ramming prey and spearing into them."
848,34,9,"It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison
to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it
can cause a tingling paralysis."
849,34,9,"This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon
chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it
might contain."
850,34,9,"It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking
them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will
voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel."
851,34,9,"While its burning body is already dangerous on
its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has
large and very sharp fangs."
852,34,9,"Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed
when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back.
It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."
853,34,9,"Searching for an opponent to test its skills
against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle
is over, it returns to the sea."
854,34,9,"The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its
home is a famous piece of antique tableware.
Many forgeries are in circulation."
855,34,9,"Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking
for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself
into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist."
856,34,9,"If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it
will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas
without people."
857,34,9,"Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to
get them to quiet down. One blow from those
braids would knock out a professional boxer."
858,34,9,"If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn
apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon
is also known as the Forest Witch."
859,34,9,"It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things
and feasting on the negative energy of the
frustrated occupants."
860,34,9,"With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the
woods. Some believe it to have the power to
make crops grow."
861,34,9,"Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs
unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring
them as tentacles would."
862,34,9,"It evolved after experiencing numerous fights.
While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that
would make any opponent flinch."
863,34,9,"After many battles, it evolved dangerous
claws that come together to form daggers
when extended."
864,34,9,"Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body
surrounding its soul. You’ll become
stiff as stone if you touch it."
865,34,9,"After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield,
it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek
stalk is both weapon and food."
866,34,9,"Its amusing movements make it very popular.
It releases its psychic power from the pattern
on its belly."
867,34,9,"Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be
shown the horrific memories behind the picture
carved into it."
868,34,9,"They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery
is guaranteed success and good fortune."
869,34,9,"When Alcremie is content, the cream it
secretes from its hands becomes sweeter
and richer."
870,34,9,"The six of them work together as one Pokémon.
Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they
constantly change their formation as they fight."
871,34,9,"It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets
broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for
at least three hours."
872,34,9,"It eats snow that piles up on the ground.
The more snow it eats, the bigger and more
impressive the spikes on its back grow."
873,34,9,"It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields
and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings,
causing a blizzard to chase offenders away."
874,34,9,"Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific
time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in
a circle."
875,34,9,"This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool
with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single
hair into the sea to lure in prey."
876,34,9,"Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions
of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the
source of its strength."
877,34,9,"It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if
they’re precious treasures. No matter how much
it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order."
878,34,9,"If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon
will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the
rain, turning a vibrant green color."
879,34,9,"These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have
incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush
giant rocks into powder."
880,34,9,"The powerful muscles in its tail generate its
electricity. Compared to its lower body,
its upper half is entirely too small."
881,34,9,"This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and
was able to preserve food with the ice on its
body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly."
882,34,9,"Its mighty legs are capable of running at
speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon
can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
883,34,9,"The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but
breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go
extinct anyway."
884,34,9,"The special metal that composes its body is very
light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility.
It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
885,34,9,"If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child
